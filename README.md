# MRTK2 Add-On for use with AndroidXR

This project adds input and interaction providers to MRTK2 to support additional OpenXR platforms, including Android XR devices.

Specifically, this package adds support for the following OpenXR extensions:

* XR_ANDROID_hand_mesh
* [XR_EXT_hand_interaction](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenXR/specs/1.1/html/xrspec.html#XR_EXT_hand_interaction)

as well as migrating to use [Unity's XR Hands package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.hands@1.6/manual/index.html) for hand joints.
